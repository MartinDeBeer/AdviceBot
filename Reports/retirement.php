    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Retirement Plan</h1>
            <p><b>Planning</b> for <b>retirement</b> starts with thinking about your goals and how long you have to save before you retire. It is also important to determine the time your money will last after retirement.</p>
            <h3><u>IFAA TIP:</u></h3>
            <p><b>"Action speaks louder than words"</b>. The most important part of any retirement plan is to put it in action. You can have great goals and a wonderful plan, but without putting that plan to work you would not accomplish much.</p>
            <h3>Tax Incentive:</h3>
            <p>The government has provided incentives for investors who invest in retirement annuities, pension funds and provident funds by providing generous annual tax deductions for these contributions. The annual tax deduction is limited to 27.5% of the greater remuneration or taxable income, capped at R350 000 per tax year.</p>
            <h3>Regulation 28:</h3>
            <p>This regulation is issued under the Pension Fund Act. It limits the extent to which retirement funds may invest in certain assets or in certain asset classes. The main purpose is to protect the member's retirement provision from the effects of poorly diversified investment portfolios. This is done by limiting the maximum exposure to more risky asset classes, making sure that no unnecessary risks are taken with retirement money.</p>
            <p>I will help you choose the best Regulation 28 compliant portfolio blend for your specific goals and risk tolerance.</p>
            <p>We can also "rebalance" your portfolio regularly so you can receive the maximum benefit from your portfolio choice.</p>
            <p>Do you contribute to a retirement plan at the moment?</p>
